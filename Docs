Installation:
1. To install variant_tools need to install libbz2-dev and zlib1g-dev. DO NOT install variant_tools using pip because that is an old version, go to the github page and install by downloading the code 
   package and run python setup.py install. swig need to be installed before install variant_tools. 
2. To install gtc, first download the htslib, because downloading it in terminal is extremely slow and may lead to installation failure. Also, cmake should be installed. 
3. To install VCFtools, first need to install autoconf. To install bcftools, install from git. Usually, bcftools is faster than vcftools.


Operation:
1. To check how many records in a .vcf.gz file, use 'bcftools index -n  filename.vcf.gz'
2. To check how many individuals and variant site are there in a .vcf or .vcf.gz file, use 'vcftools --(gz)vcf filename'
3. In variant simulation tools, each simulation is a model in a pipeline file. The simulations shown by 'vtools show simulations' are on a server, one can download the pipeline files and modify it and  	 run it from local.
4. To compress a .vcf file to .vcf.gz file, install tabix. And 'bgzip -c file.vcf > file.vcf.gz','tabix -p vcf file.vcf.gz' 
5. If 'vtools simulate ...' fails, delete all previous simulated files and try again.
6. To slice a vcf.gz file by samples, install bcftools, than 'bcftools view -S/s indexFilename/sampleNames -o output.vcf.gz -O z inputFile.vcf.gz'
7. To slice a vcf.gz file by variant sites, 'bcftools view -r 22:16050075-18000000 gene1000chr22.vcf.gz -O z -o gene1000chr22_1605_1800.vcf.gz'
8. To concatenate .vcf.gz files along variant sites axis, 'bcftools concat gene1000chr22_1605_1800.vcf.gz gene1000chr22_1800_1801.vcf.gz -O z -o gene1000chr22_1605_1801.vcf.gz'
9. To concatenate .vcf.gz files along sample axis, 'bcftools merge gene1000chr22_1605_1800.vcf.gz gene1000chr22_1605_1800OtherSamples.vcf.gz -O z -o largePopulation.vcf.gz'
10. To check list of samples, number of samples, list of positions, refer http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/query.html
11. To reserve a CPU for testing gtc, refer https://blog.csdn.net/chinagissoft/article/details/50476036
12. To specify a CPU to execute programs, refer http://xmodulo.com/run-program-process-specific-cpu-cores-linux.html  Combine 11 and 12 to test gtc.
13. To empty the buffers cache, 'sudo sh -c 'free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free''
14. To change samples' names of a .vcf.gz file, use 'bcftools reheader -s newSampleNameFile -o output.vcf.gz input.vcf.gz'
15. When variant simulation tools doesn't work, try run it with internet connection, because it may rely on some file on the server.


Information:
1. In gene1000chr22 position is from 16050075 to 51244237.
2. 'vtools simulate my' can work on a range of 2,000,000 bp.  
3. Base pair(bp) positions in filenames, only show the first 4 digits. For the first and last bp in a .vcf file, it means the exact position number, like 1605 in gene1000chr22 means 16050075, the position 	of the first record in that file. For the middle bps in a .vcf file, when the number shows as a end position, like 1605_1800, then 1800 means 18000000, when it shows as a start position, like 1800_2000, then 1800 means 18000001. 
4. The Genome 1000 project data can be downloaded from http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/, pay attention to the annotation database used, because the Variant Simulation Tools needs to use corresponding annotation database to simulate.

Something need to be dug in:
1. GTC decompressed .vcf file has more variant sites than the original one.
